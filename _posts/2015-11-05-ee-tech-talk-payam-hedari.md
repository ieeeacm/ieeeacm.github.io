Millimeter-wave and Terahertz Integrated Circuits in Silicon Valley: Challenges and Solutions

Thursday, October 29, 5:30pm &#124; Room 2-105

This talk gave an overview of recent advances in designing silicon-based integrated circuits will be capable of operating close to the maximum operation limits of silicon-based transistors. The talk then discussed in depth about two case studies designed in UCI’s Nanoscale Communication Integrated Circuits (NCIC) Labs; namely, the world’s highest fundamental frequency fully differential transceiver in CMOS at 210 GHz, and the world’s highest frequency PLL-based Synthesizer in Silicon at 300GHz with a wide tuning range.  

Payam Heydari

*Professor of Electrical Engineering
University of California, Irvine*

His research covers the design of terahertz/millimeter-wave/RF/analog integrated circuits. He is the (co)-author of two books, one book chapter, and more than 120 journal and conference papers. He has given Keynote and Distinguished Speeches to a number of IEEE conferences and forums. He is the Distinguished Lecturer of IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society.
