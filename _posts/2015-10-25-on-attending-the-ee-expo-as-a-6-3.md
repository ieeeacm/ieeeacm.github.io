title: "On Attending the EE Expo as a 6-3"
date: "2015-10-25"

The EE Expo happened last week, and it was a ton of fun and somewhat of a bittersweet experience being there to photograph it as a 6-3. All the company presentations and the networking fair got everyone really exicted, but as a 6-3, I probably won’t be able to work on these projects, unless I switch to a more EE focus in the future.

I missed the first half of the expo, but was there for company presentations and the networking fair, which I thought were the main parts of the expo.

We first heard from Analog Devices, where Tom Edward advised everyone to not specialize too early in order to explore everything that EE has to offer. He discussed the Internet of Things, a trend for different object sin our ecosystem to adapt to work with the internet. Analog Devices also has quite a range of roles for students, so if you’re interested in silicon chips, you should definitely check them out. 

Keith Acosta, from Bose Corporation, then pumped everyone up by talking about how EE gets a full range of experience from mathematics to seeing your product being used in industries ranging from aerospace to telecommunications.

Intel talked about their mission to touch human life with low power design on circuits, clocking, power management, power delivery, etc. They also have a ton of internship opportunities that encourage diversity!

One of the company presentations that I really enjoyed was iRobot’s, as they talked about the design process and different stages in the production of a vacuuming robot. iRobot talked us through the challenges that came up and how they managed to solve them, which I thought was really interesting.

Brian Robinson then talked about the MIT Lincoln Lab, where EE is the largest group represented, last summer they had 240 students working there, and they have plenty of internships that tackle real problems with innovative solutions.

We then heard from Sam Nork of Linear Technology, where they make a wide variety of very high performance analog integrated circuits for numerous markets and applications. Sam told us that one of the most enjoyable things to him working with these products is learning about all the different ways that people use them.

Lockheed Martin’s presentation focused on the space industry! They mentioned that they had many internship opportunities and that in Lockheed Martin, you have the ability to switch projects or even working locations very easily.

Maxim Integrated talked about the evolution of EE, and particularly, Moore’s Law, which is proof of they he’s still in the EE industry, and why industries will keep needing more and more electrical engineers. 

Alice Wang, from MediaTek, talked to us about how they focus on the design, not so much the manufacturing, of integrated circuits for smartphones, bluray players, etc. Alice mentioned that MediaTek has a big focus on third-world countries and on impacting people all around the world. They also have internships not only in the US, but also all around the world!

During their presentation, MITRE mentioned how they specialize in research and development regarding government work on problems of global importance. Check out mitre.org/students to check out their strong student internship program dealing with fields like communications, energy, surveillance, and reconnaissance. 

The next organization was SMART, the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology. Some of their highlights from their presentation was that they have a lot of opportunities and programs for students in Singapore! Also, they’ve worked on cool projects like a replication of an invisible cloak a la Harry Potter. The times to apply for their program (SMURF) are Nov 23rd to Jan 22nd, so if you’re interested you should check it out!



Thomas Lewis, from Texas Instruments told us that he loved his job, but that he would never say that it’s easy, which I think sums up EE and pretty much everything at MIT.

He also listed the Top Ten Reasons to be an EE:
10. You don’t like to sleep
  9. You have no life and you can prove it mathematically
  8. You like surprising people with your social and dance skills.
  7. You like having everyone assume you know how to fix everything.
  6. You like to break things.
And for the more serious reasons:
  5. It has a universal appeal.
  4. “Hands on” Discovery.
  3. Breadth of Applicability.
  2. Access to jobs.
  1. Society needs you.

Vanu Bose, from Vanu, Inc., talked about their focus on innovation to provide innovative wireless infrastructure solutions to enable operators to access new markets and new revenue streams. They were the smallest company in the expo, so Vanu said that they don’t have time to put interns on side projects, so interns would be getting real, interesting projects. 

Finally, WiTricity ended the company presentations with an awesome demo. WiTricity’s focus is wireless power and charging. Their demo showed the long range of their wireless charing pads! They mentioned that last year they had 10 interns, so if you’re interested in a smaller company and in fields ranging from analog electronics to mechanical engineering or research & design, I would recommend applying to them.

Well, that concludes the company presentations! 

Thanks so much to everyone who came to the expo. The networking fair was great, as EE freshmen and sophomores got plenty of great one-on-one time with many great industries. I personally had a blast hearing about all the cool projects, photographing, and seeing a couple of my friends around the expo.

Also, props to the Voltage team for organizing this great event!
